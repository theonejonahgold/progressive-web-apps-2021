## Getting started

This program is built with Go@^1.16. This means that you have to install one of the Go 1.16 versions via the [golang website](https://golang.org). Also make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed with [Yarn v1](http://classic.yarnpkg.com) or (non-preferably) the [NPM package mananger](https://npmjs.com).

### Installing the project

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/theonejonahgold/progressive-web-apps-2021.git pwa
$ cd pwa
$ go get && yarn # or "npm i"
$ go build -o pwa main.go
```

With this sequence of commands, you create a binary called `pwa` in the project root. While working on Henkernieuws, you use this binary to interact with your dev environment. **Do not use NPM scripts. They do not work**. If you want the NPM scripts to run, run `go install` first.

### Available commands

```sh
$ ./pwa start # Serves the contents of the dist folder, only useful if you've already prerendered the site.
$ ./pwa build # Downloads all henkernieuws data, and prerenders the entire site, also running snowpack to build everything.
$ ./pwa dev   # Runs a Fiber (express-like) server dynamically serving handlebars templates.
```

## Features

- [x] Static file serving
- [x] Prerendering as build step
- [x] Separate dynamic dev server
- [x] Best HackerNews clone to ever exist
- [ ] Client side routing
- [ ] Caching with service workers
- [ ] Custom JS API functions
- [ ] Periodic rerendering on production
- [ ] Making Node.JS unnecessary as a requirement
